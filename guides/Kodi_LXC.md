We'll use the script created by user [mrrudy](https://github.com/mrrudy).

To be able to use a keyboard, mouse, or any USB controller after installation, we must install the container with privileges.

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrrudy/proxmoxHelper/main/ct/kodi-v1.sh)"
```

Be patient, it takes time to install.
Access to tty7 means we can now connect our monitor or TV.

### Keyboard, Mouse, or USB Controller

The keyboard, mouse, or USB controllers are /dev/input devices. To add them to the LXC, we need to know their code:

```bash
ls -l /dev/input
```

![Input devices list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MacRimi/vmenu/main/guides/kodi/kodi1.png)

In my case, the code is 13.

We add to our LXC configuration:
For example, 102 is the id of my Kodi container

```bash
nano /etc/pve/lxc/102.conf
```

Add these lines:

```
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow = c 13:* rwm 
lxc.mount.entry: /dev/input dev/input none bind,optional,create=dir
```

When we're done, we restart Virtuliser:

```bash
reboot
```

### Updating Kodi

Inside the container's console:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-xbmc/ppa
```

```bash
sudo apt install kodi kodi-bin
```

When it's finished, we restart, and when it boots up, we'll have Kodi updated.
